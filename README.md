This loader is built using 1 control only - an image. All of the icons, animation and text are contained within the SVG code.

It can be easily imported into your Canvas Apps as a component and used immediately. It is fully scalable so you can expand it or reduce its size as you wish to fit both your mobile and tablet form factors.

The component itself has the following properties:

- LoaderType - this is the type of your loader. You can add the following values here
- "1" - three animated circles
- "2" - spinning modified circle
- "3" - spinning half circle
 - "4" - Power Apps logo
- "Bonus" - Microsoft logo

- LoadingText - this is the text you can see under the logo, if you don't want any text just leave this blank. Please ensure your text is wrapped in double quotes (")
- - BackgroundAnimationSpeed - this defines the speed of animation. By default, it is set to 11s to give nice transitions between colours. Please note that the shorter the time, the quicker it will animate. Because of the difference between colours, please ensure that the speed is not under 3s as it could be triggering to those suffering from epilepsy.
- BackgroundCoolour1, BackgroundColour2 etc. - these the colours that will be animated. If you want this to be 1 colour, please set all of the coolour properties to the same colour. 


Hope you enjoy using this in your apps!

As always, if you have any questions, please drop me a message. Any feedback always welcome!
